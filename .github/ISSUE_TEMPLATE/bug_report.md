**Describe the bug**
The bug is an error screen that pops up randomly when i try to run code on visual studio

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Run a piece of code on Microsoft visual studio
2. do not close the display of the output
3. Change a few things in the code and rerun it
4. The error is shown as you tried to run the code

**Expected behavior**
I expected the code to run regardless but instead an error is thrown even after the previous output is closed
